This project was with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Health Care Web App

This is an education App built with React, React Router and Bootstrap cdn.

### Installation

- Please clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/jahidorjahid/health-care-client-side/` first. There will be two package.json files, one for the server side and the other for the client side.
  This is because server and client have to start at the same time. If you do not have NPM installed, please do so at `https://www.npmjs.com`. This is also a very good project for having a starter platform with react.js.

- In your directory after cloning please do the following:

> Install dependencies

```shell
$ cd health-care-client-side
$ npm install
```

> Run this app

```shell
$ npm/yarn start
$ npm install
```
